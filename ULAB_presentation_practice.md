## Title
- don't say "angular distribution of H0" -- it's not something that's distributed
- what's being analyzed is the "observed value" of cosmological constants

## background

- add motivation (what is cosmology??)
	- maybe you can talk about some ultimate goals of cosmology
----------------
- refer to the difference between Hubble constant and Hubble rate
- learn more about cosmological constants (how many are there? what's lambda-CDM model? show equation!)
	- also talk about the background history (Hubble, Einstein, etc.)
- Standard candles and standatd rulers comparison is good
- show equations whenever technical topics apper
- show pictures (CMB,BAO,TypeIa SNe, etc.)

----------------
- cosmological principle, so what? (this can be resolved by talking about the 'motivation' or history of cosmology)
- CMB angular variation = CMB anisotropy
- refer to the scale of fluctuation (= very small)



## Question
- don't just focus on H0 because it's very tough


## Methods
- include more diagrams and equations
- refer to the difficulty of finding absolute magnitude
- Hubble used cepheids instead of Type Ia SNe(?), Type Ia SNe is relatively new standard candle
- refer to the actual method of BAO -> H0 process
- Cross correlation to something different! (CMB is more sensitive to larger z value)
	- maybe you can do both

## budgets
- good
- as Alex pointed out, talk about how to use data

## Collaborations
- good
