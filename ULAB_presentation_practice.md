## background

- add motivation (what is cosmology??)

----------------
- Hubble constant and Hubble rate
- learn more about cosmological constants
- Standard candles and standatd rulers comparison is good
- show equations
- show pictures

----------------
- cosmological principle, so what?
- CMB angular variation = CMB anisotropy
- refer to the scale of difference



## Question
- don't just focus on H0 because it's very tough


## Methods
- include more diagrams
- refer to difficulty of finding absolute magnitude
- Hubble used cepheids instead of Type Ia SNe?

- Cross correlation to something different! (CMB is more sensitive to larger z value)
	- maybe you can do both

## budgets
- good

## Collaborations
- good
